# Digital Polaroid Camera #

*Emma Kidney 20074350*

For my project, I wish to create a camera that can be used for events, such as weddings, parties or even personal use. 
The photos that are taken from the device will be uploaded onto a designated webpage that can be assessed by anyone. 
The idea is to create a log of memories from the event without the interference of people wishing to delete or retake photos. 
This is so people can actually enjoy the event for what is it and bring back the pre-smart phone atmosphere. It somewhat replicated 
a disposable camera, where you have cannot change photos once they are taken. It can also be used as a personal blog to document 
ones life solely in pictures. For an added retro-feel, a thermal printer can be introduced to print the photos once they are taken, 
simulating a Polaroid camera.
